# LEDController
Smart home controller
Designed to use the AIY hat and the raspberry pi (pi hat functionality was used for LED testing)

Bluetooth
Bluetooth scanning finctionality added, whitelist of devices planned for controlling what connects using 
a .txt file or something similar

LEDs
will be tested using the "Govee" LED strips for bluetooth, ano others will use pins 12, 13 and 18 on the pi
or the servo arms on the AIY hat to control the LED colours for a normal 4 pin LED strip

Video colours
Camera input tested and works, video cards should work the same way but i will test this, attempting to use RCA video through
one of the analogue inputs for video but very very early on

Audio colours
using the audio device, growndwork has been set for this but it still very early and untested, should have more testing done
in coming weeks
